# Artificial Intellignece Final Project

This is an application that visualizes discovering the way out in a maze by using one of two basic search methods: DFS (LIFO data structure - a stack) and BFS (FIFO data structure - the queue). 
The result of the algorithm (the route in the maze) is presented graphically. App also shows the length of the discovered route. The maze is loaded from a text file. An example of the text file is presented at the end of the page.

_In route discovering the following rules apply:_

- The route cannot go through the wall (thick line in Figure 1),
- One move following directions are allowed: up, down, left or right.

Following directions must be checked when deciding on the choice of next step: up, left, down and finally right.

_Additional functionality of the application:_

- Graphical possibility of creating a new maze,
- Presentation of the successive steps of algorithm,
- Implementation of two methods of searching,
- Comparison of two algorithms in terms of time for complete and length of discovered routes.
